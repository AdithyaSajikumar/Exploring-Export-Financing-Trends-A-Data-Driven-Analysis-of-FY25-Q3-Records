Through data preprocessing, unnecessary columns are dropped, headers are standardized, missing values are handled, and data types corrected. This ensures the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.\n",

    "- Revealing approval trends and seasonal/annual patterns.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Highlighting financial risk exposure through outstanding loans and interest rates.\n",

These insights guide recommendations such as diversifying global financing, supporting underrepresented businesses, focusing on high‑demand sectors, managing loan risks better, and aligning programs with seasonal demand.\n",
